        <img src="assets/images/about.jpg" alt="origin story picture" />
        <p>Thanks to innovative chefs and delicious homegrown ingredients, the island of Hawaiʻi is fast becoming a hot
            spot for foodies. Fresh and local produce is at your fingertips throughout the region, whether you’re
            splurging on an elegant beachside dinner at a Kohala resort, feasting on kālua pig and poi at a lūʻau or
            grabbing a quick al fresco lunch of grilled shrimp and slaw from a food truck.

            In many locales, all around the island, you’ll find creative eateries taking full advantage of the island's
            cattle ranches, fresh seafood and hearty vegetables grown in the island’s rich, volcanic soil. From
            traditional Hawaiian cuisine to refined New American fare and a variety of Asian cuisines, the choices are
            as vast as the landscape. No matter where you eat, a cup of locally grown coffee is the perfect way to
            finish off any meal on the island of Hawaiʻi. The local beans are so good, you might want to consider a tour
            and tasting at one of the nearby coffee farms in Kona or Kaʻū.</p>
